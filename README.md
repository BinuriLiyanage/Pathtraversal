The Path Traversal Vulnerability Challenge introduces you to a common web security flaw where attackers manipulate file paths to access unauthorized files on the server. In this challenge, you are presented with a web application that has a file access feature vulnerable to path traversal. Your task is to exploit this vulnerability by injecting special characters like ../ into the file path to traverse directories and retrieve the hidden flag file. For instance, by manipulating the file parameter in the URL, you can access sensitive files such as flag.txt. To mitigate such vulnerabilities in real-world applications, it is crucial to validate and sanitize user inputs, use whitelists for file access, restrict directory traversal, and ensure the server operates with least privilege. Proper implementation of input validation, secure file handling practices, and using Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can significantly reduce the risk of path traversal attacks. Upon successful exploitation, you will retrieve the flag, confirming the vulnerability. Congratulations on completing the challenge!
